' To specify which control(s) to resize (and how), you set the control's .Tag property at design time to
' indicate that the control's top, left, width and height should be adjusted as the form's size changes.
'
' Use the letters t, l, w and h in any order (or not at all) to state that the property should change as the form
' is resized.  Follow the property by a decimal to indicate that the control should change by a percentage of the
' form's change.
'
' For example:
'   hw           Sets the control's height and width to change with the form (e.g. if there's a single list box on the form)
'   tl           Sets the contol's top and left to change in line with the form (e.g. to keep it in the bottom-right corner)
'   w0.5         Sets the control's width to change by 0.5 that of the form's width change
'   w0.5l0.5     Sets the control's width and position to change by 0.5 that of the form's width change
